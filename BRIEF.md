# Descent
## A Journey to the Center of the Earth

---

## Vision

An immersive, poetic experience that takes you on a journey falling through a tunnel to the center of Earth. This is an **experience**, not a physics demonstration—prioritizing emotional impact, narrative, and visual beauty over mathematical accuracy (though grounded in real science).

As you fall down, you descend deeper into Earth. The experience combines beautiful 3D visualization, intimate second-person narrative, real physics data, and cinematic camera movement.

## The Thought Experiment

The classic physics problem: What happens if you drill a hole straight through Earth's center and jump in?

**The realistic answer (our focus):**
- You die almost immediately from heat and pressure
- Terminal velocity with air: ~200 km/h
- Time to center: approximately one week
- After death, your dust continues falling for the remaining 97% of the journey

**The idealized answer (referenced at the end):**
- In a vacuum tunnel with no friction: 38 minutes 11 seconds
- Maximum speed: ~28,800 km/h at Earth's center
- You'd emerge on the other side with zero velocity

## Narrative Arc

The story is told in second person, present tense. You are the protagonist. The tone shifts from anticipation to horror to meditation to wonder.

### Phase 0: The Edge (Surface)
You stand at the edge. The tunnel yawns before you. 6,371 kilometers to the center. What happens if you jump?

### Phase 1: The Plunge (0–1 km)
You step forward. The fall begins. Gravity accelerates you. The walls blur past.

### Phase 2: First Death — Heat (1.1 km)
Your skin burns. 47°C. Heat stroke takes you quickly. Your consciousness fades.

### Phase 3: Second Death — Boiling (2.7 km)
Your body, lifeless now, continues down. 127°C. Your fluids begin to boil.

### Phase 4: Third Death — Crushing (25 km)
Deeper than any human has ever been. 20 atmospheres of pressure. Bones crack. Flesh compacts.

### Phase 5: Final Death — Incineration (200 km)
Through the crust, into the mantle. 927°C. Bone becomes ash. Flesh becomes dust. You are no more.

### Phase 6: The Long Fall (200–2,900 km)
Your dust falls. And falls. And falls. Days pass. The mantle surrounds you—hot, solid rock flowing like honey over eons. You are scattered atoms now, falling through an alien world.

### Phase 7: The Outer Core (2,900–5,150 km)
Everything changes. A sea of molten iron and nickel, as hot as the surface of the sun. A liquid metal ocean generating Earth's magnetic field. This place is incomprehensible. This place is beautiful.

### Phase 8: The Inner Core (5,150–6,300 km)
The pressure is so immense that iron becomes solid again. A sphere of crystalline iron, larger than the moon. You're almost there.

### Phase 9: The Center (6,371 km)
Gravity pulls equally in all directions. Weightless. Your dust floats suspended in the iron heart of the world. You have fallen through an entire planet. The journey took one week—but really, it took 4.5 billion years.

## Earth's Structure

| Layer        | Depth          | Character              |
| ------------ | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Crust        | 0–35 km        | Rock, familiar         |
| Upper Mantle | 35–660 km      | Hot solid rock         |
| Lower Mantle | 660–2,900 km   | Denser, hotter, alien  |
| Outer Core   | 2,900–5,150 km | Liquid iron ocean      |
| Inner Core   | 5,150–6,371 km | Solid crystalline iron |

## Pacing & Rhythm

The experience should breathe. Not every moment is equal.

**Slow down at:**
- The edge (anticipation)
- Each death (gravity, horror)
- Layer transitions (wonder)
- The center (arrival, meditation)

**Speed up through:**
- The long fall (passage of time)
- Familiar territory

**Pause for:**
- Temperature reveals (47°C, 127°C, 927°C)
- Big distance markers (2,900 km, 5,150 km, 6,371 km)

## Emotional Journey

| Phase      | Emotion                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Edge       | Curiosity, anticipation |
| Plunge     | Exhilaration, fear      |
| Deaths     | Horror, mortality       |
| Long Fall  | Meditation, acceptance  |
| Outer Core | Awe, alienness          |
| Inner Core | Wonder                  |
| Center     | Peace, belonging        |

## Success Criteria

The experience succeeds if:
- They say "this made me feel something"
- They share it
- They learn something about Earth without feeling lectured

The experience fails if:
- It feels like a physics textbook with pretty graphics
- It feels janky
- The narrative is boring or too technical
- People abandon it halfway

## Guiding Principles

1. **Experience over education** — Make them feel the scale, not memorize facts
2. **Poetry over precision** — Evocative language, not scientific jargon
3. **Show, don't tell** — Let the visuals and pacing do the work
4. **Respect the science** — Don't make things up, but simplify freely
5. **Intimacy** — Second person, present tense, you are there
